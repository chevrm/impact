IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences bryostatin_BryC_3_KS10_adiMebketo and bryostatin_BryB_2_KS5_adiMEbketo are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file traintest_split_04_train_hmmalign.phy.reduced
