IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 577 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 578 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences bryostatin_BryB_2_KS5_adiMEbketo and bryostatin_BryC_3_KS10_adiMebketo are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file traintest_split_09_train_hmmalign.phy.reduced

Alignment has 2 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
