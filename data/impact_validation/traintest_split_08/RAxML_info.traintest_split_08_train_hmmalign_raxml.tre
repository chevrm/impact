IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 585 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 586 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file traintest_split_08_train_hmmalign.phy.reduced

Alignment has 2 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
